    <h1>Welcome to the Student Absence Detection System</h1>
    <p>
      Our system is designed to streamline the process of tracking and managing student attendance. 
      By utilizing RFID technology, each studentâ€™s presence is automatically recorded as they enter 
      the classroom. This ensures accurate, real-time monitoring and helps to efficiently manage 
      absences, providing a reliable way to keep track of students attendance throughout the academic year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system offers easy integration with existing academic platforms, allowing administrators 
      to generate reports, analyze attendance trends, and take necessary actions to improve 
      student participation and performance. Start managing attendance more effectively today.
